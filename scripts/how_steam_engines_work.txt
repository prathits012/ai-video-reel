SEGMENT: "Steam engine mechanics and history"  
LYRICS:  
[Beat Drops]  
[Verse]  
Coal goes in the firebox, burnin' it hot,  
Boilin' up the water in the pressure pot.  
Steam expands, pushin' pistons back and forth,  
Driving wheels rollin' from the South to the North!  
[Chorus]  
Cylinders workin', that’s the heart of the beast,  
Turning steam to power, watch the motion increase!  
[Verse 2]  
Condensation cools, water flows back to the source,  
Creating a cycle, it’s a powerful force.  
From factories to trains, steam engines paved the way,  
Industrial revolution, brightening the day!
